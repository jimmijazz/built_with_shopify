                              <h4><strong>Could you tell us a bit about the story behind Luks Linen and what you sell?</strong></h4>
                              <p><a href="<%= link %>">L&uuml;ks Linen</a> is a purveyor of handwoven home and lifestyle goods. We work with family ateliers in Southern Turkey to produce lifetime lasting products including towels, blankets, throws and cushions.</p>
                              <p>L&uuml;ks was a sun-bed epiphany, whilst holidaying in Kalkan 3 years ago I noticed the locals using beautiful cotton peshtemals not only as beach towels but also as sarongs and wraps. A few hundred miles from home I thought that I could set up a business
                                  importing and selling these here in the UK. The cultural narrative and artisan craft behind these products was the icing on the cake and allowed me to fulfil a lifetime passion to work with and support local craftsmanship.</p>
                              <h4><strong>Has ecommerce been apart of Luks linen since you started? When did you get started with Shopify and why did you choose it?</strong></h4>
                              <p>Yes, absolutely, whilst we do wholesale to a few select retailers the vision was always to work online as it automatically gives us a much broader reach. We now work with Paypal globally and are localised in over 40 countries.</p>
                              <h4><strong>What are your most successful marketing avenues?</strong></h4>
                              <p>Facebook advertising has always seen an uplift in conversions although Instagram is becoming increasingly important to us as the visual nature of our products lends itself to the platform.</p>
                              <p>Growing our email list and consistent communication with existing customers has also paid dividends - as an ethical company with sustainable ethics and lifetime products we have a rich story to tell (in addition to promotions, new products and offers).</p>
                              <p>Community networking has also been very beneficial to L&uuml;ks as a result of which we have been able to increase our presence and brand visibility, collaborate on partner projects and garner editorial coverage. I cannot stress the importance of PR in
                                  the marketing mix.</p>
                              <p>We are also venturing into live events for the first time this year - so we&rsquo;ll see how that goes.</p>
                              <h4><strong>Did you build your Shopify store yourself or hire a designer and how long did it take to launch?</strong></h4>
                              <p>I initially built our Shopify store myself. I come from a design and advertising background and whilst I understood the importance of UX and how a site should look actually making it happen was a new experience for me and one that I really enjoyed. It
                                  has also been commercially beneficial to know the ins and outs of my site so I am not reliant on 3rd parties.</p>
                              <h4><strong>What theme are you using? Have you done any theme customizations?</strong></h4>
                              <p>Currently we are using <a href="http://react-white.myshopify.com/">React</a>, however we are in the process of updating the site which has been as is for 2 years now and for the refresh we did employ a designer to create customizations.</p>
                              <h4><strong>What Shopify apps do you use? Which apps are most important to your business? </strong></h4>
                              <p>Where to start&hellip;</p>

                              <h4><strong>What would you do differently if you had to start over? Are there any blogs or resources that have been helpful for you?</strong></h4>
                              <p>Hmmm - I don&rsquo;t like to dwell on what has been as it has all been a learning curve. One thing I will say is that I would have done more homework on understanding what all the web builder platforms offered - I made the mistake of building my website on another platform before realising Paypal was not an option which is when I discovered Shopify - and thank goodness I did!</p>
