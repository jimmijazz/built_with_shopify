  <p>With Shopify, setting up an online store is not a difficulty and doesn&rsquo;t require a great investment. Selling online can be a big moneymaker because of its low cost including: no rent and utilities of a real store.</p>
  <p>However, running an online business or offline business won&rsquo;t guarantee profit. It&rsquo;s not so easy to attract new customers and sell them your products. Indeed, 80% of entrepreneurs starting an e-commerce site fail within the first 18 months.&nbsp;<strong>What are the reasons for this colossal failure rate?</strong></p>
  <p>Each business has its own essence, though, we will generally collect some common reasons for this failure. Studying these factors, you may know what should be done to rocket your business.</p>
  <h2>Mistake #1: Too competitive market</h2>
  <p>Product is the core issue of any business. What should you sell? &ndash; The first biggest question of any storeowner. You can come up with tons of ideas like T-shirts, girl clothing, shoes, or bags when thinking about starting an online store. You know what? Although these markets are easy to join, they are ultra-competitive ones.</p>
  <p>So what is the impact of choosing a competitive market?</p>
  <ul>
  <li>You may never appear in search engines because of competitive keywords in that niche.</li>
  <li>You are the late comer so discount or price competitive tactics might be invited, which means less profit.</li>
  <li>It is hard to be better than the old one. There is narrow space for you to stand out.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You know the equation of selling: Profit = Demand * (Revenue &ndash; Expenses)</p>
  <p>If you come to a niche which is too narrow,&nbsp;there won&rsquo;t be enough customers. If you pick a niche that is too broad,&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll face too much competition.</p>
  <p>Ideally, you had better pick a product or a set of products that isn&rsquo;t readily found in brick and mortar stores and doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of online competition. More importantly, there should be enough demand for you to make profit that meets your business goals.</p>
  <p>Most people pick a niche that they are passionate about but they don&rsquo;t take into account the potential profit. These entrepreneurs find it hard to have customers and barely make any money.</p>
  <h2>Mistake #2. Lack of Customer Service</h2>
  <p>What is the sort of customer service in ecommerce when you don&rsquo;t have sales representative who can directly speak to customer? Customer service is the support you offer your customers &mdash; both before, during and after the purchase. </p>
  <p>Customer service helps build a friendly bridge between a business and customers. It adds values in enhancing customer experience. What customers would ask for a good customer service is not only an answer to their problem but also the promise your brand has committed.</p>
  <p>The signs of a poor customer service delivery can be named several. Customer requests are answered slowly; Customers don&rsquo;t know how to contact you; When customers have problems with your product, they will be frustrated if they don&rsquo;t&rsquo; receive support from you.</p>
  <p>And the consequences will be:</p>
  <h3>Decline of Word-of-Mouth Sales</h3>
  <p>Unhappy customers may have a tendency to discourage other people from doing business with you. It is very dangerous because it possibly marks down the brand image and finally leads to &nbsp;financial problems of your business.</p>
  <h3>Decline of Repeat Customers</h3>
  <p>Do you know that it costs way less to retain current customers than it does to attract new ones. If you offer products that are as good as your rivals&rsquo;, then a superior service will becomes the competitive advantage! Then a failure in remaining a good customer service will definitely affects your group of available customers who you have been working hard to approach.</p>
  <h2>Mistake #3: Don&rsquo;t know your ideal customers</h2>
  <p>After you do research on products, you come to hunt for customers. Most people know the statistics about their customers but the step that many don&rsquo;t consider is to visualize the ideal customers and specifically draw a detailed picture of them.</p>
  <p>If you dig deep enough, you will find that niches have niches within them. The more you can target, the better, since it will be easier to identify with your customer&rsquo;s needs.</p>
  <p>Customer understanding is also meaningful when you use information to target customers in Facebook advertising.</p>
  <h2>Mistake #4: Fail to have a good Marketing Plan</h2>
  <p><em>&ldquo;Fail to plan, plan to fail&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>When you already know who your customers are, setting up a marketing plan should be easy. If not, it seems like you are walking in the dark. You do one thing one day, and other ones in another day. You don&rsquo;t have a certain strategy to focus your resources on.</p>
  <p>While every ecommerce store should have a well-rounded marketing plan that covers all bases, some channels will obviously be more effective than others. For some businesses, SEO is good but for others, social media is better. </p>
  <p>It is of the utmost importance so consider to have a careful marketing plan now, which should be designed to meet up and beyond customer&rsquo;s expectation. Put an effort to upgrade your store to quite a level of looking professional and convenient for e-shoppers. <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/partners/secomapp">Secomapp</a> has developed a set of apps that helps you do (Quick View saves time when browsing products, Banner Slider does a colorful makeup to your stores with glamorous banner styles, Currency Switcher gives your foreign customers a hand with different currencies and many more)</p>
  <p>Giving customers<a href="https://apps.shopify.com/freegifts"> free gifts</a> is also a good marketing strategy when you are just starting out.</p>
  <p>Whatever your plan is, don&rsquo;t forget to track it then have suitable in time adjustment.</p>
